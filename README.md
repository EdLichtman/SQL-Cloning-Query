# SQL-Cloning-Query
This clones information and allows you to find and replace certain values.
You will enter data such as table name and "WHERE" restrictions. You will receive "INSERT" queries that allow you to 
insert the data into another table with the same Columns. You can find even a value in the copied data and replace it with 
another value. This isn't complete as it only accounts for certain data types.
